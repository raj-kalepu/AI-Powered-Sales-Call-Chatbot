# Test Log: Cold Intro 1

---

## Scenario: User initiates a cold call simulation to introduce a new project management tool.

**Initial State:** User is on the Home page, ready to start a new chat.

---

## Steps & Observations:

1.  **Action:** User clicks "Start Chat" on the landing page.
    **Expected:** Navigates to Chat Interface, chat history is empty, input field is ready.
    **Actual:** Navigated successfully to `/chat`. The interface loaded quickly, with an empty message list and an active input field.

    **Screenshot (After):** `assets/screenshots/cold_intro_1_2_chat_interface_empty.png`

2.  **Action:** User types "Hi, this is Sarah from Ascent Solutions. We've developed a new AI-powered project management platform. Do you have a moment to discuss how it could optimize your team's workflow?" and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** User message appears on the right, AI typing indicator shows briefly, then AI response appears on the left.
    **Actual:** User message rendered correctly. AI "is typing..." indicator displayed. AI responded after ~3 seconds: "Hello Sarah! While I appreciate you reaching out, I'm currently quite busy with project deadlines. What makes your platform different from others we might have already considered?"

3.  **Action:** User types "Our platform leverages predictive analytics to anticipate project roadblocks and suggests optimized resource allocation, reducing delays by up to 20%. It integrates seamlessly with popular tools like Jira and Slack. What current tools are you using for project management?" and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI acknowledges the value proposition and asks about current tools to identify pain points.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "That's an interesting claim about predictive analytics. We primarily use Asana for task management and some custom spreadsheets for resource tracking. Our biggest challenge is often communication breakdowns between remote teams."

## Issues Identified:

* **UI/UX:** The "AI is typing..." indicator animation sometimes feels a bit jumpy on slower network conditions, making it less smooth.
* **Functional:** The "Send" button becomes briefly re-enabled if the user double-clicks very quickly, allowing for duplicate message submissions before the AI response arrives. This should be prevented.

---

## Refinement Notes:

* **Frontend (`LoadingIndicator.jsx` & `Chat.module.css`):** Adjusted the CSS animation timing and properties for `dot-animation` to ensure smoother visual feedback, even under slight delays.
    ```css
    .dot-animation {
      animation: blink 1s infinite steps(1, start); 
    }
    ```
* **Frontend (`chat.jsx`):** Added additional logic to the `sendMessage` function to ensure the `disabled` state of the send button and textarea remains strictly `true` while `isLoading` is `true`.
    ```javascript
    const sendMessage = async () => {
      if (inputMessage.trim() === '' || isLoading) { 
        console.log("Message empty or already loading, preventing send.");
        return;
      }
      // ... rest of the function
    };
    ```
