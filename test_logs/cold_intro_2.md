# Test Log: Cold Intro  2

---

## Scenario: User attempts a direct approach to scheduling a follow-up meeting early in the call.

**Initial State:** Chat interface, after the initial greeting.

---

## Steps & Observations:

1.  **Action:** User (acting as sales rep) types "Good morning! My name is Chris from DataGenius. We specialize in AI-driven data analysis that helps companies uncover hidden market trends. Are you open to a quick 15-minute call next week to see a live demo?" and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI acknowledges the direct request, might express mild interest or a mild objection.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "Good morning, Chris. A live demo sounds interesting, but I'm not sure if this is the right time. Could you perhaps send me some more information first, outlining typical use cases and ROI?"

2.  **Action:** User types "Of course! To tailor the information, could you briefly tell me what your primary challenges are with your current data analysis processes, if any?" and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI provides some high-level pain points.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "Well, we struggle with the sheer volume of unstructured data from customer feedback, and it takes too long to get actionable insights from our sales pipeline data."

## Issues Identified:

* **Functional:** If the backend (Flask) server is not running, the frontend currently displays a generic "Error: Failed to get AI response" without clearly stating a connection issue.
* **UI/UX:** The message bubbles, when displaying very long words without spaces (e.g., a long URL or an accidental string of characters), can sometimes overflow the bubble boundaries slightly on smaller screens.

---

## Refinement Notes:

* **Frontend (`chat.jsx`):** Modified the error handling within `sendMessage` to check for `response.status` or `response.json().error` to provide a more descriptive error message (e.g., "Error: Could not connect to backend. Please ensure the server is running.") when appropriate.
    ```javascript
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending message:', error);
      let errorMessage = `Error: ${error.message}. Please try again.`;
      if (error instanceof TypeError && error.message.includes('fetch')) {
        errorMessage = "Error: Could not connect to the backend server. Please ensure it is running.";
      }
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [
        ...prevMessages,
        { role: 'system', text: errorMessage, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() },
      ]);
    }
    ```
* **Frontend (`MessageBubble.jsx` & `Chat.module.css`):** Ensured the `word-break: break-word;` property is robustly applied to the message text to handle long strings gracefully within the bubble's `max-width`.
    ```css
    .messageBubbleText {
      word-break: break-word; 
      overflow-wrap: break-word; 
    }
    ```
