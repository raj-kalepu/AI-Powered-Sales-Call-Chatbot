# Test Log: Objection Handling 2

---

## Scenario: User handles a "lack of urgency" or "not a priority" objection for a new cybersecurity solution.

**Initial State:** Chat interface, mid-conversation, after the value proposition has been presented.

---

## Steps & Observations:

1.  **Action:** User types "This sounds interesting, but honestly, cybersecurity isn't a top priority for us right now. We haven't had any major incidents recently." and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI acknowledges, creates a sense of urgency or highlights potential future risks without being alarmist.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "I appreciate your honesty. It's great you haven't faced issues, and we want to help keep it that way. Many companies often delay security upgrades until after an incident occurs, which can be far more costly. What does your current incident response plan look like?"

2.  **Action:** User types "Our current incident response is pretty basic. We rely on our IT team to handle things as they come up." and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI subtly highlights the risk of a "basic" plan and introduces how their solution mitigates it.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "That's understandable. However, with the evolving threat landscape, a proactive and automated response is becoming critical. Our solution offers real-time threat detection and automated remediation, which can significantly reduce the burden on your IT team and minimize downtime during an attack. How often do your IT team members get pulled away for security-related issues?"

## Issues Identified:

* **AI Response Quality:** The AI's follow-up question ("How often do your IT team members get pulled away...") is good but could be slightly more tailored to reinforce the *cost* of a "basic" plan.
* **Functional:** When pasting very long text into the input textarea (more than 500 characters), the textarea's auto-resize doesn't always keep up instantly, causing a slight flicker before resizing correctly.

---

## Refinement Notes:

* **Backend (`chat_routes.py` - AI System Prompt/Context):** Added a subtle instruction to the AI's system prompt to connect pain points to *cost implications* where relevant during objection handling.
    ```python
    messages_for_openai = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI sales assistant... When handling objections, connect current pain points or risks to their potential financial/operational cost to the user's business."}
    ]
    ```
* **Frontend (`chat.jsx`):** Investigated and optimized the `textareaRef.current.style.height = textareaRef.current.scrollHeight + 'px';` logic, potentially using `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother updates or setting a max-height limit to avoid excessive resizing.
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      if (textareaRef.current) {
        requestAnimationFrame(() => {
          textareaRef.current.style.height = 'auto';
          textareaRef.current.style.height = textareaRef.current.scrollHeight + 'px';
        });
      }
    }, [inputMessage]);
    ```
