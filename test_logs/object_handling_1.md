# Test Log: Objection Handling 1

---

## Scenario: User practices handling a "too expensive" objection for a software license.

**Initial State:** Chat interface, mid-conversation, after the AI has mentioned pricing.

---

## Steps & Observations:

1.  **Action:** User types "The price seems a bit high compared to other solutions we've looked at." and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI acknowledges the budget concern and attempts to justify value or differentiate.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "I understand. While our pricing reflects the advanced AI capabilities and comprehensive support, can you elaborate on what aspects of the cost are giving you pause? Perhaps we can explore different package options or focus on the ROI you'd gain."

2.  **Action:** User types "Well, our budget for new software this quarter is quite constrained. We're looking for something under $500/month." and clicks "Send".
    **Expected:** AI probes for specific budget details or tries to reframe the value against the budget.
    **Actual:** AI responded: "Thank you for that clarity. While our standard package is above that, many clients find our solution pays for itself within months through efficiency gains. Could you tell me, what's the financial impact of the problems you're currently facing that our software aims to solve?"

## Issues Identified:

* **AI Response Quality:** The AI's response to the direct budget constraint is good but could be more empathetic before pivoting to ROI. It sounds a little too robotic.
* **UI/UX:** When the chat window gets very long, the scroll position sometimes jumps around slightly when new messages appear, instead of smoothly scrolling to the bottom.

---

## Refinement Notes:

* **Backend (`chat_routes.py` - AI System Prompt):** Refined the system prompt to instruct the AI to incorporate more empathetic language and acknowledge the user's situation before shifting focus to solutions or value.
    ```python
    messages_for_openai = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI sales assistant. Your goal is to help users practice sales calls. Be helpful, engaging, and guide the conversation towards a sale, handling objections professionally. **When facing objections, first acknowledge and validate the user's concern before pivoting.** Keep responses concise and focused on sales interactions."}
    ]
    ```
* **Frontend (`ChatWindow.jsx`):** Reviewed the `scrollToBottom` logic to ensure `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'end' })` is used consistently and efficiently, potentially adding a slight delay or checking for user's manual scroll position.
    ```javascript
    const scrollToBottom = () => {
      const isScrolledToBottom = messagesEndRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().bottom <= messagesEndRef.current.parentElement.getBoundingClientRect().bottom + 50; 
      if (isScrolledToBottom) {
        messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'end' });
      }
    };
    ```
